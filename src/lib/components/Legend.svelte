		What is a "critical mineral"?U.S. law<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> defines critical minerals as those that the Secretary of
		the Interior determines to meet three criteria:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>They are essential to the economic or national security of the United States;</li>
		<li>
			Their supply chain is vulnerable to disruption. These disruptions can include foreign
			political risk, abrupt demand growth, military conflict, violent unrest, anti-competitive or
			protectionist behaviors, and other risks throughout the supply chain.
		</li>
		<li>
			And, they serve an essential function in the manufacturing of a product that, should we go
			without it, would have significant consequences for the economic or national security of the
			United States. These products can include those in energy technology, defense, currency,
			agriculture, consumer electronics, and health-care.
